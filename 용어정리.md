**Connection**<br>

- Application과 RabbitMQ Broker 사이의 물리적인 TCP 연결

**Channel**<br>

- Connection 내부에 정의된 가상의 연결

<br>

>Many applications needs to have multiple connections to the broker, and instead of having many connections an application can reuse the connection, by instead, create and delete channels. Keeping many TCP connections open at the same time is not desired, as they consume system resources. The handshake process for a connection is also quite complex and requires at least 7 TCP packets or more if TLS is used.<br>
>
>A channel acts as a virtual connection inside a TCP connection. A channel reuses a connection, forgoing the need to reauthorize and open a new TCP stream. Channels allow you to use resources more efficiently (more about this later in this article).
